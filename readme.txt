Create MULTIPLE, ROTATABLE TopBars that will be shown at the top of your website.  TopBars are selected by a variety of options - includes scheduler! 

== Description ==

What is a TopBar?  It is a special message/image that you can show at the top (or bottom) of your website.  WP-TopBar allows you to create an **unlimited** number of TopBars.   They are cacheable and randomly selected based on the criteria you select, including start time, stop time and more.  You can provide a weighting to skew selected TopBars to show up more often.  It is super-duper customizable, even easy to add your own PHP and CSS. 

Version 5.23 adds a new option to force to the TopBar to stay fixed on the top of the page when it is scrolled.  For non-scrollable TopBars, it will push the page down and not overlay the top of your webpage.

Version 5.21 changed how the HTML is generated to make it quicker to startup and also easier to use more complicated custom PHP... all behind the scenes.  Now you can enter in custom PHP like this and it works! (of course, You'll need to style it with CSS to make it pretty!):  echo do_shortcode('[gallery id="123"]');  

Version 5.17+ is now i18n compatible -- now I just need your help adding new translations. (I did include a French translation -- but only about ~10% is actually translated.) You can also now have your own custom TopBars added to the Samples tab (see FAQ for details).

Version 5.14 gives you more Rotation options, makes it easier to enable/disable a TopBar and gives you more control with Network installs.

Version 5.13 adds a new Global Settings page.  You can now select to **rotate** through all valid TopBars on each pageview.

You can create an unlimited number of TopBars that:
<ul>
	<li>Have their own color, CSS styling, and buttons (for Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, etc.)</li>
	<li>Have a bacground image</li>
	<li>Have a close button</li>
	<li>Have a re-open button that shows after a TopBar is closed</li>
	<li>Have custom CSS or PHP that is executed with each TopBar.  Of course, that can be super dangerous if you enter PHP code that is invalid -- you could break your website.  That option should only be used by Advanced Swimmers only.</li>
</ul>

You can have the Plugin show only **one*TopBar*** or display ***every*** valid TopBar that you've create (they are rotated in and out).

TopBars can be:
<ul>
	<li>Scheduled based on time</li>
	<li>Shown only for mobile, non-mobile or all users</li>
	<li>Shown only on the home page -- or not shown on the home page</li>
	<li>Shown only for certain categories -- or excluded from certain categories</li>
	<li>Shown only on certain Pages -- or excluded from certain Pages</li>
	<li>Shown only when the user scrolls the page down </li>
	<li>Given a Priority -- to ensure that more important messages are shown more frequently</li>
</ul>
More details on the selection logic can be found on [here.](http://zwebify.com/wp-topbar/wp-topbar-selection-logic/)


The TopBars are always statically created to take advantage of caching plugins.

Want to create a lot of TopBars -- you can copy the existing ones with just a few clicks.   Know SQL?  You can even export the TopBars in three different formats (JSON, CSV or SQL).    Sorry, **no support** is given if you import directly to the database.

With so many option pages, I only included a few screen images.  More images can be found on [zWebify.com](http://zwebify.com/wp-topbar/)

Here is a crazy-long list of options you have for each TopBar -- and this is not even complete!

<ol>
	<li>Enable/disable the TopBar without disabling the plugin.</li>
	<li>Place the TopBar Above the Header or Below the Footer</li>
	<li>Amount of time (in milliseconds) for the TopBar to appear. Enter 0 for no delay.</li>
	<li>Amount of time (in milliseconds) for the TopBar to take to slide down on the page. Enter 0 for no delay.</li>
	<li>Amount of time (in milliseconds) for the TopBar to stay on the page.  Enter 0 for the TopBar to not disappear.</li>
	<li>Pick the date/time for the TopBar to start showing.</li>
	<li>Pick the date/time for the TopBar to stop showing. Of course, it must be after the start time. Select 0 for the TopBar to never disappear.</li>
	<li>Whether to show the TopBar for logged in users, not logged in users or all users.
	<li>A lot of CSS options -- and even a way to enter your own CSS in</li>
	<li>Retrict the Topbar to show on only certain pages (or to not show on those pages)</li>
	<li>Retrict the Topbar to show on only certain categories (or to not show on those categories)</li>
	<li>Add social buttons to the TopBar</li>
	<li>Add a Close Button</li>
	<li>Option to execute your own PHP or CSS code before (or after) the TopBar is created</li>
	<li>Has explicit support for qTranslate -- translates the top bar text fields and link field.</li>
	<li>You can have unlimited number of TopBars -- the plugin randomly selects one (based on individual weightings) to show </li>
	<li>The TopBars are generated in such a way to support cacheing (e.g. W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache)</li>
</ol>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have a new translation  =

Contact me to help with a translation: http://zwebify.com/contact/  I will install at the next update.

Current translations are provided by:

= My TopBar is not working. What should I do? =
Are you upgrading from an old version?   I do my best to allow for clean upgrades.  Just in case, try creating a default TopBar.  If that works, you may have CSS or other incompatabilities on the older TopBar that does not work with the latest version.  

Also, check for any messages under the Live Preview heading on the Admin Page. It will tell you if you have cookies or time settings that will prevent the TopBar from loading.  

You may have custom CSS or HTML settings that prevent the TopBar from loading. If you entered any setting that are not valid, the TopBar will not load. Try deleting the settings and then re-entering your custom CSS or HTML until you find the one that is causing the issue.

You can also use the Debug page to see if you can see an error.

= HELP! I am using custom PHP, CSS or HTML and now my website is broken =
Don't Panic! 
You have two options to fix this:
1. Append &nopreview to the url when you are trying to edit a TopBar. E.g. https://www.dummy.org/wp/wp-admin/?page=wp-topbar.php&action=phptexttab&barid=422116&nopreview.    Hit ENTER to reload the page. You should now be able to edit the custom php.
2. Go into your database tool (usually using phpMyAdmin), find the wp-topbar table and delete the offending row. 

= My TopBar does not support my local language = 

The problem is with your table collation. You need to change the collation to utf8_general_ci.

Run this query from your phpMyAdmin to change the collation.  
Make sure to change the word DATABASEPREFIX below with your database prefix from your wp-config.php file.

ALTER TABLE 'DATABASEPREFIX'_topbar_data CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci

Of course, make a backup of your table first!

(Thanks to samhat for help on this one!)

= How can I have my own custom TopBars show on the Samples tab? = 

First create all the TopBars you want as custom Samples.   Then export the TopBars in the JSON format.   Now, create a location on your server to store the files.   For example ../wp/wp-content/plugins/wp-topbar-samples.   Next rename the export file to custom_topbars.json. Now move that file, plus any images you need into the directory you created.  Finally, go to the General Settings Tab and enter the URL for the directory in the "Custom Samples URL" field.  Make sure you have <code>allow_url_fopen</code> turned on in your php.ini (otherwise, we cannot read the file.)  Now, the TopBar will first display the Standard samples then the TopBars from your custom_topbars.json file.  You can then copy these new TopBars just like the Standard samples.   

= How do the Rotate Toolbars Global Setting work? = 

This new settings will select all the valid TopBars that can be shown on a pageview (e.g. those that match all the control, date/time criteria.)  Then it will rotate through the TopBars in priority order - with the TopBars with the highest priority shown first.   This option will override the use of Close Buttons or Re-open Buttons.  It will also ignore the Scroll Action option.   You can set the delay between TopBars on in the Global Settings tab.

= How does the Include/Exclude logic work behind the scenes? = 

You have four choices to handle include (or exclude) the TopBar from showing:
 Page ID - this only checks the current page's ID against the list you entered.
 Category ID - this only checks the current category IDs against the list you entered.  The criteria is satisfied if any of the page's category IDs match what you entered.  We only check the default "category" taxonomy.
 Both - both the Page ID and Category criteria must match for the TopBar to show
 Either - either the Page ID or Category criteria need to match for the TopBar to show
 
The default is to check by PageId.

= How do the cookies work behind the scenes? = 

If you allow the user to close the TopBar, then the plugin checks to see if you have enabled cookies.   If they are not enabled, it deletes any existing cookies.   If they are enabled, it looks to see if a cookie has been created.  A cookie is only created if the TopBar has been previously closed by the user.  If it finds a cookie, it prevents the TopBar from showing.

If you change the Cookie Value to something new, the TopBar will show up again.  This is useful if you want to force the TopBar to show on new content.  Make sure to select something you haven't used before.  A good idea is to increment the value by one every time you want to force the TopBar to show.

With Version 4.00+, all TopBars must share the same cookie settings for this to work. You can set the TopBars to be the same by using the new Close Button tab on the main page

= How does the Priority field work? =

The Plugin randomly selects a valid TopBar to show using this field to skew how they are selected. The TopBar multiplies a random number (between 0 and 1) with the TopBar's Priority value (which is a number between 1 to 100). A higher number means this TopBar will be selected more frequently; a lower number means less frequently. 

= How so I delete a TopBar? =

On the All Tables view, select the TopBars via the Check Box and selete the "Delete" function from the Bulk Actions drop down list.

= How are TopBars selected to show? =

See the Priority question above to see how they are selected. The TopBar will select only those TopBars that are valid per the date/time criteria. Once a TopBar is selected to show, it then goes through the Control Options. That checks to see if the TopBar should be shown on the Home Page (or not) and which Page IDs or Category IDs the TopBar should show (or not).

The Final check is to see if the TopBar has cookie controls (see above). If the user is allowed to close the TopBar and cookies are enabled, then we look for a cookie. If one is found, and it matches the cookie value, then the TopBar is not shown.

= What TimeZone should I use when I enter Start/Stop Times =

You should enter the time in the same timezone that WordPress is setup to use.  (See the WordPress|Settings|General tab).  

We also print the current WordPress time on the Control Tab right next to the Start option field.  Use that to guide how you should enter the time in.

= What CSS ID's are available? =

Use "#topbar"

= What if I want to fix the TopBar to the top of the page? = 

Use the Force TopBar to Be Fixed On Top of Page (on the Main Options Tab).

= What if I want to create my own Default TopBar? =

See the file SAMPLE_wptb_custom_default_values.php for instructions on how to do that.

= How to Find the Page ID = 

You can find the Page ID in the Edit Post or Edit Page URL. For example, the page ID for the following example is “1234.”

http://example.WordPress.com/wp-admin/page.php?action=edit&post=1234

= How do I test the TopBar? = 

To test the TopBar on your site, you can set the Page IDs (in Main Options) to a single page (and not your home page) and select Include/Exclude Logic to be "Page IDs". Then go to that Page to see how the TopBar is working.

= Why does my TopBar look odd on Internet Explorer? = 

IE does not (yet) implement gradients like other browsers.  So, make sure you test your TopBar on all the major browsers.

= How dow I uninstall? = 

Go to the Uninstall tab (or if are on a Multi Site install, you first need to login as a Super Admin then select the Uninstall from the TopBar Menu List) and then click the Uninstall button at the bottom of the page.   You'll be sent to the WordPress Plugins page. Now deactivate and uninstall the Plugin
